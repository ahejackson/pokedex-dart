# pokedex

A Dart package providing core functionality for Flutter apps that
improve the experience of Pokemon Video Game players, such as damage
calculators and team sharers.

## Credits

This project is based on the hard work of the creators of Pokemon Showdown, PokePaste
and the Damage Calculator.

## Getting Started

This project is a Dart
[package](https://flutter.dev/developing-packages/),
a library module containing code that can be shared easily across
multiple Flutter or Dart projects.

The goal of the library is to make it easier to build apps to support the Pokemon
player base by implementing core functionality such as:

- Display basic Pokemon information
- Import and Export sets in the standard Showdown format
